# **App Name**: AI API Bridge

## Core Features:

- Text-to-API Conversion: Translate natural language prompts into API calls using a large language model, letting users create custom APIs with no code. The tool decides which public data and user data should be integrated to build each API.
- Dynamic Data Visualization: Visually represent the data flow with animated particles in the background, mimicking constellations.
- Interactive API Selection: Present combined API options as visual cards that can be selected to build a customized API call.
- Modular Dashboard: Use a customizable bento grid layout to display key metrics, API health status, and AI analysis logs on the dashboard.

- Primary color: Electric Blue (#4F46E5) to highlight data and AI activity in the app.
- Background color: Deep Midnight Blue (#0A0A1A) to set a dark, sophisticated tone.
- Accent color: Frosted Glass Gray (rgba(200, 200, 220, 0.1)) for card backgrounds and separators.
- Headings & UI Font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for modern readability and a bold impression.
- Code Font: 'JetBrains Mono' (monospace) for developer-friendly API snippets.
- Represent data sources with icons connecting to a central AI core.
- Subtle animations of particles flowing in the background to represent the stream of data, creating a constellation effect.
